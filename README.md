# Sales_Predictions
Data-Science Project 1


The purpose of this project was to help develope the tools and skills needed to take a data set, clean it up, evaluate it, and test several different models of prediction to aid in determining the probable sales of an item.

We came to several conclusions:

	If seeking to launch a new product, it will have a greater chance of preforming well if launched at Outlet 027

 
	Top 3 products carried amoung outlets are:
1: Fruits and Vegatables
2: Snack Foods
3: Household Goods

 
	Even with these discrepancies in quantity, the average sales brought in by each category varies slightly, creating a well rounded shopping experience.

 


	Most outlets carry roughtly the same number of goods, except Outlet 010 and Outlet 019.
